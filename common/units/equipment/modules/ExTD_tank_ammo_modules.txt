	#Here's a quick rundown of the situation:
	#in order to have a dedicated slot for ammunition, I had to specify a new slot in tank_designer_view.gui, and apparently
	#the role of such slot is defined in order of declaration inside of the tank_chassis.txt file (units\equipment)
	#meaning that, the first module_slot declared in tank_chassis.txt will take the first pos_custom_module_slot_window_x, and so on
	#So, as a workaround for all the module slots made by the first dev (which I couldn't be bothered to see which one goes where), I set the ammo slot as the first one
	#This creates a problem though, which is I can't stop mechanised from not using the ammo slot, which I wanted to do.
	#Therefore, here are the mech ammo which are different from tank ammo
	#prefix mech_ is for modules for both tanks and armoured cars (why mech_ explained by comment lower)
	#suffix _actual_mech is for modules used by mechanised
	
	#in the end most of the above has been rendered ineffective by the fact that I decided to let mech use normal ammo
	
	
	#initially I wanted to give these ammo only for mech, then I realised that was bs and so these two have the "mech" prefix
	#can't be bothered to change it everywhere <3
