USA_radial_engine_supremacy:0 "Radial Engine Supremacy"
USA_radial_engine_supremacy_desc:0 "With the two powerhouse engine makers Pratt & Whitney and Curtis Wright, the U.S. had an undeniable lead in radial engine technology. P&W developed the famous 18 cylinder R-2800 Double Wasp engine boasting 2000 hp with a turbosupercharger, 3 years ahead of the Germans in this tech, an engine that would go on to be used until 1960."
GER_interceptors:0 "Interceptor Design"
GER_interceptors_desc:0 "Germany needs a fast, heavily armed fighter to intercept Allied bombers.  Kurt Tank at Focke-Wulf has a promising prototype that we must encourage.  The German government will provide extra resources to ensure its success."
